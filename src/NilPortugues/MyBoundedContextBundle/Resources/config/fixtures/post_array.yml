      title: The new Silicon Valley trailer has broken walls, broken dreams, and synergy
      body: "Mike Judge's slapstick tech world comedy Silicon Valley returns for a second season next month, and last night HBO unleashed a new trailer to make the wait a little easier. Or harder, depending on how you look at it. The clip features the Pied Piper gang getting ready to brain-battle it out with their Nucleus competitors. How do they do that? \"Getting Pied Piper out there.\" \"Brand awareness.\" \"Synergy, bitches.\"  That, in a nutshell, is what you can expect from this season. Also maybe Gilfoyle setting stacks of cash on fire and Jared speaking with the soft cadence of a nervous angel. The season premieres on April 12th."
